# rtfm_base
## port_scanners
 - port_scanner_range.py 
   - this is the best of the bunch, ask the user for the ip, the range of ports to scan, and timeout in ms from start to end for how long to conduct each interaction
 - rtfm_port_scanner_fix_192.168.1.1.py
   - this was the first test I did to make the rtfm's scanner work, it only scans the os critical ports from a 192.168.1.1 host
