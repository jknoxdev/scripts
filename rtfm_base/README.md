# rtfm_base
## port_scanners
 - [port_scanner_range.py](https://github.com/jknoxdev/scripts/blob/main/rtfm_base/port_scanners/port_scanner_random.py) 
   - asks the user for the ip, the range of ports to scan, and timeout in ms from start to end for how long to conduct each interaction
 - [rtfm_port_scanner_fix_192.168.1.1.py](https://github.com/jknoxdev/scripts/blob/main/rtfm_base/port_scanners/rtfm_port_scanner_fix_192.168.1.1.py)
   - this was the first test I did to make the rtfms scanner works, it only scans the os critical ports from a 192.168.1.1 host
